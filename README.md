#Open Fonts Download
A set of files to download open licensed fonts from fontsquirrel.com.

##Contents
These are a set of high quality fonts that can be used for web projects without worrying about licensing.
Each download list is in a folder with it's own category:

* blackletter 
* calligraphic
* comic
* commands.sh
* dingbat
* display
* handdrawn
* monospaced
* novelty
* pixel
* programming
* retro
* sans_serif
* script
* serif
* slab_serif
* stencil
* typewriter

##Usage 
'commands.sh' has a list of bash commands to download the zip files in to their category folders using wget.
Subsequent commands will unzip the files. Run these commands in the project root. 

##Notes
There are a few fonts with appropriate licenses that are available offsite. This result in downloads of web pages for some fonts. I am still deciding how to handle these fonts. Any ideas welcome!
